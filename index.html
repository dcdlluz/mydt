              The Pokemon I Would Choose For My Ultimate Team
            </span>
          </h2>
            <p>In the Pokemon universe, trainers are allowed a maximum of <b>six</b> pokemon to carry with them on their team.
            <p>Ever since I was a kid, I always imagined what kind of pokemon I would like to have on my own team. There were so many pokemon that I thought were really cool or strong when I was younger, but my preferences significantly changed over time. Now that there are over <i>800</i> pokemon out there to choose from, I think I have finally decided on which pokemon I would carry with me on my own team if I lived in the Pokemon universe.</p>
            <p>Here is a list of categories that I mainly took into consideration while making this team:</p>
            <OL type="1">
              <LI>cuteness</LI>
              <LI>nostalgia</LI>
              <LI>usefulness</LI>
              <LI>strength</L1>
            </OL>
            <HR style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:black;background-color:black">
            <p>To start off, I definitely would include some pokemon that I have more of an emotional connection with.</p>
            <center>
            <p>My favorite pokemon of all time is <A href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pachirisu_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Pachirisu!</A> Here is an image of the lil guy:</p>

            <p>Pachirisu is for sure number one on my list. He is just super cute! One of my favorite colors is blue, and my second favorite color is pink. And guess what Pachirisu's shiny form color is? <b><i>IT'S PINK!</b></i> Pachirisu was an easy catch in the Diamond/Pearl DS games, so I had it on my team from the very beginning. I think Pachirisu would be a very useful addition to a team, he'd make great company. He is also surprisingly strong, as the 2014 Pokemon VGC world champion would prove, clevery using a Pachirisu on his team to make his way to victory! I just have a lot of love for this little electric squirrel!</p>

            <p>Next off, the second pokemon on my list is another one that I have loved for a really long time. </p>

            <p>Gengar has always been super cool to me. I love ghost type pokemon, and I think Gengar's design is awesome! I think having this pokemon on my team would be the best, his prankster personality would be super fun to have around, and he just looks so cute! Gengar is already incredibly strong with his very useful ghost and poison type moves, but he can also mega evolve, making him even more powerful and cooler looking! Unfortunately, in the pokemon universe only one pokemon on your team can mega evolve, and I have another pokemon on this team that I would rather mega evolve instead. But Gengar's potential is still there, and I acknowledge how awesome he is.</p>
